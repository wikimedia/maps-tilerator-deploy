  "readme": "# osm-bright.tm2source\nData source for [Kartotherian's fork  of OSM Bright](https://github.com/kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2)\n\n# Requirements\nSee [Kartotherian documentation](https://github.com/kartotherian/kartotherian/blob/master/README.md) for details. **Be sure to import the OSM data with `--hstore` parameter**.\n\n# Layers\nThe order of layers in this style matters because that's the order that they will be drawn on map. Note that the list of layers goes from bottom to top, opposite to the order in files.\n* `landuse` - various uses for land: wood, park, industrial zone, etc. Mostly corresponds to OSM's [`landuse` key](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:landuse).\n* `waterway` - [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:waterway](streams, rivers on low zoom, etc).\n* `water` - water bodies (oceans, lakes, rivers wide enough on a given zoom level to be represented by areas as opposed to lines).\n* `aeroway` - both areas and lines related to airports: [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:aeroway](tarmacs, taxiing lines, etc).\n* `building` - buildings.\n* `road` - roads and other similar transport ways: streets, bridges and tunnels.\n* `admin` - [http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dadministrative](administrative borders) between countries and regions.\n* `country_label` - country labels.\n* `place_label` - city/neighborhood/district labels.\n* `road_label` - road labels, including highway number shields.\n  \n# Editing\nTo edit this data source, you need to have some OSM data on your local machine. Follow [data set up instructions](https://github.com/kartotherian/kartotherian/blob/master/README.md#in-depth-step-by-step) from [Kartotherian](https://github.com/kartotherian/kartotherian).\n* Install the latest [Mapbox Studio Classic](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio-classic/)\n* Clone [osm-bright.tm2source](https://github.com/kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2source) repository (this one)\nOpen Mapbox Studio and open the data source. You should see your data as \"x-ray\" outlines. Don't edit just data.yml or data.xml - they must be in sync; editing this project in MBS only ensures that.\n\nTo see the data in style\n* Clone [osm-bright.tm2](https://github.com/kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2) repository\n* Edit style's project.yml - change the `source:` to `\"tmsource:///home/user/.../osm-bright.tm2source\"` directory.\nOpen it in the Mapbox Studio.\n",
