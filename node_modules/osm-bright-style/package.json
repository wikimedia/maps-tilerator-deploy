  "readme": "# OSM Bright for Kartotherian\n\nA fork of Mapbox's style of the same name, intended for [Kartotherian](https://github.com/kartotherian). [osm-bright.tm2source](https://github.com/kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2) is the corresponding datasource, vanilla Mapbox vector tiles aren't fully supported.\n\n# Using this style\n\nClone it:\n\n```git clone git@github.com:kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2.git```\n\nThe font dependencies for it are in a separate repository, managed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```\ncd osm-bright.tm2\nnpm install\n```\n\nUnfortunately, to open this style in Mapbox Studio you need to edit it to point it to the right location of [datasource](https://github.com/kartotherian/osm-bright.tm2) on your machine:\n\nIn project.xml, replace with your path:\n```<Parameter name=\"source\"><![CDATA[tmsource:///Users/msemenik/dev/osm/osm2pgsql-osm-bright.tm2source]]></Parameter>```\n\nIn project.yml:\n```source: \"tmsource:///Users/msemenik/dev/osm/osm2pgsql-osm-bright.tm2source\"```\n\nRelative paths are not supported:(\n\n# Changing this style\nAlthough user directly modifies only *.mss and project.yml, project.xml is wat gets fed to Mapnik so it has to be kept in sync. Mapbox Studio does it for you so if you had to change something otside of it, just load the style in the Studio, make a null edit to affected file and save the project.\n\nYou can easily edit this style using the tiles hosted on maps.wikimedia.org - load mapbox studio, open the style, click \"Layers\", change source, and enter https://maps.wikimedia.org/osm/pbfinfo.json as the source.  The link will show an error if clicked from this site due to the referer header, but will work from the studio.  Note that Mapbox Studio 2.7 has a bug that prevents this, but the custom built by Mapbox is  [available here](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-studio/issues/1268#issuecomment-135673871), and it should be fixed in the future versions.\n",
